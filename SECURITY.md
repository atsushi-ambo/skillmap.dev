## Secure Development Practices

### Secret Management
- Never commit sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or tokens to the repository
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Store secrets in `.env` files (which are included in `.gitignore`)
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipeline

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
- Use Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates
- Review and audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities

### Code Review
- All changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member
- Pay special attention to security-sensitive areas (authentication, authorization, data validation)
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues
